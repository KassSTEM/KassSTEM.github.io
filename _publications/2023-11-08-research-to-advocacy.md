Abstract
======
Professional organizations like the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology and the National Academy of Engineering have emphasized the importance of social responsibility for modern engineers. Scientific communication and policy advocacy are promising teaching approaches to foster the development of critical thinking skills in undergraduate researchers related to social responsibility. Scientific communication, or SciComm, is the practice of turning scientific knowledge into accessible and engaging content geared towards the general public. By making empirical data and reasoning more understandable, SciComm can help people make better decisions and inform public policymaking. Policy advocacy involves actively supporting and engaging with specific policies. Given their specialized knowledge and expertise, engineers are well-suited to engage with the public and promote science-based policies.

To instill the importance of critical thinking and social responsibility, engineering students should learn about SciComm and policy advocacy starting in their undergraduate years. In this presentation, we will describe the results of a two-day workshop that took place during the Summer of 2023. This workshop aimed to create awareness of the role of scientists and engineers in policy decision-making, and to develop effective communication strategies to engage with the public on policy issues. On Day 1, the workshop covered the importance of scientists and engineers in policy decision-making, effective communication strategies, and group activities to craft a clear and compelling message for policy communication. On Day 2, participants engaged in a group practice session where they learned to communicate complex scientific information in accessible terms. This session included feedback on the participants’ communication skills. The workshop concluded by providing sources and materials on effective communication strategies and policy decision-making for further learning and development. Preliminary data was collected before and after the workshop took place using the VSRoSE validated survey instrument and open-ended questions. This work is part of a major study exploring the importance of social responsibility in undergraduate engineering research experiences.
