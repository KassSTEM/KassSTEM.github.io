Abstract
======
This work in progress details the methods used to conduct a scoping literature review (ScR) on the current state of the literature concerning institutional culture and transformational change in engineering education. The purpose of this study is to investigate the intersection between institutional culture and evidence-based practices for transformational change in engineering education. As this has yet to be mapped adequately in the engineering education literature, the research team expanded the search to the broader body of STEM literature on higher education institutions in the U.S. The completed study will identify current trends, theories, and potential gaps in the literature.

**Keywords:** *scoping review, institutional culture, theories of change, transformational change*
