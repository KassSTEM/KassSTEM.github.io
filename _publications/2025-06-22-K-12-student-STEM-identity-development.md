Abstract
======
The Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers (GGEE) Summer and Afterschool Programs are informal learning programs designed to provide opportunities for middle school students to build skills in programming, computational thinking, and engineering design by bringing camp experiences to students in their communities. The programs are designed to be engaging while providing enough scaffolding to support the development of conceptual knowledge, skills, and confidence throughout the program. This paper discusses the impacts of the GGEE program on student science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) identity before, during, and after participation in the 2024 summer programs.

This study aims to investigate the impacts of the GGEE summer program on the development of STEM identity in middle school student participants. To measure the impacts on the development of STEM identity, three validated survey tools were modified to fit the needs and perspectives of the summer programs: the single-item STEM Professional Identity Overlap (STEM-PIO-1) measure, Role Identity Surveys in STEM (RIS-STEM), and Student Attitudes toward STEM (SSTEM). These tools focused on different aspects of STEM identity formation: 1) overall STEM identity formation by measuring how much students feel like they overlap with a scientist or engineer, 2) role identity in STEM constructed from interest, competence, and recognition, and 3) attitudes towards STEM regarding 21st-century skills. Students were also asked to rate their coding skills before and after participation in the summer program to support the measure of competence in STEM identity.

As a result of participating in the summer programs, student participants experienced an increased level of STEM identity. There was a 107% increase in the percentage of students pre-to-post who felt their identity overlapped closely with a scientist or engineer. Student STEM identity measured through role-identity and 21st-century skills also experienced increases in students strongly agreeing or feeling the most confident across all survey questions. The marked shifts in students toward an increased STEM identity indicate that the GGEE summer programs have positive impacts on developing STEM identity in students.
