Workshop Description
======
This hands-on session will introduce teachers to our FREE camps "in a box" for computational thinking and engineering design thinking. We will present a short overview of our Middle School Camps: Energy Science and Engineering Camp, the AI in Agriculture Camp, The Goldberg Gator Engineering Explorers Camps and the High School camps for Sports and Music Data Analytics, AI in Agriculture, Programming a musical chatbot and Storm Tracking and predictions. These camps use free or lost-cost resources such as Micro:bits, Minecraft Education, and MatLab programming or python jupyter notebooks. In this workshop, teachers will get to build out an example activity for AI gesture recognition in Micro:bits, Program an Agent to build your farm in Minecraft education, and track a hurricane using Matlab and open-source data sets. These Camps are all CC Share alike non-commercial and teachers can use these in summer camps, after school or classroom materials. We will also discuss how we worked with school districts and community groups to find funding to support these camps. These camps employ a near-peer mentoring model and we employ local engineering students to work as mentors in the programs.
