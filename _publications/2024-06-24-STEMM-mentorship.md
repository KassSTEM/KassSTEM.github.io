Abstract
======
In this critical theory review paper, the researcher seeks to 1) reveal the current landscape of the research literature on science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) mentorship that occurs within student organizations at institutions of higher education, 2) determine if the mentorship described in these articles exemplify critical mentorship as defined in the literature, and 3) determine if the addition of critical mentorship components adds value, defined here as a synergistic effect, for STEMM students who serve as mentors or mentees through their student organizations. As the intersection of STEMM mentorship and student organizations at institutions of higher education remains underrepresented in the literature, this paper also highlights the need for more studies in this area.

Mentorship is an important topic in STEMM education due to its role in a student’s professional formation. Defined as “a professional, working alliance in which individuals work together over time to support the personal and professional growth, development, and success of the relational partners through the provision of career and psychosocial support,” mentorship may “enhance student outcomes, experiences, and retention” and “help with workforce development by increasing access, equity, and inclusion in STEMM” [1]. A mentorship relationship can last anywhere from three months to a lifetime and is most effective when critical theories are applied to mentoring practice [1], [2]. Practicing critical mentorship, however, requires that social constructs, such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status, be examined through a critical lens such that the mentorship relationship is “at once reciprocal, collaborative, participatory, emancipatory, and transformative” [2]. Involvement with student organizations has been shown to have a positive effect on student success, especially for students from historically marginalized communities (HMC) [3]. STEMM mentorship that occurs through student organizations should, therefore, have a synergistic effect.

A three-stage methodology was utilized: 1) Components and activities related to mentorship, referred to here as mentorship indicators, were extracted from the relevant literature and a thematic codebook was developed. 2) A scoping review of the literature was conducted to identify articles related to STEMM mentorship in student organizations in higher education. 3) Using the codebook developed in stage 1, reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on articles selected in stage 2.

The findings presented answer the following questions: 1) What is the current landscape of the research literature on STEMM mentorship that occurs within student organizations at institutions of higher education?, 2) Does the mentorship described in these articles exemplify critical mentorship as defined in the literature?, and 3) Does the addition of critical mentorship components have a synergistic effect for STEMM students who serve as mentors or mentees through their student organizations? While this review is laser-focused on STEMM mentorship that occurs within student organizations at institutions of higher education, it will lay the groundwork for future work on the role critical mentorship plays in the professional formation of STEMM students, regardless of their level of education.
