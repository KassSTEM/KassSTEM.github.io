SNAP is a coalition of early-career scientists dedicated to mobilizing for large-scale initiatives and bridging gaps between scientists, their communities, and the general public. Our mission is to inspire and engage fellow scientists by establishing a peer network, developing and sharing resources, and instigating meaningful change. 

I created and maintain SNAP's website, which you can visit by [clicking here](https://snapcoalition.org/).
