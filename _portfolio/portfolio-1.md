The [Inclusive STEM Teaching Project](https://www.inclusivestemteaching.org/) program is designed to advance the awareness, self-efficacy, and ability of STEM faculty, postdocs, graduate students, and staff to cultivate inclusive learning environments for all their students and to develop themselves as reflective, inclusive practitioners. Drawing on embodied case studies and vignettes, participants engage in deep reflection and discussions around topics of equity and inclusion in learning environments across a variety of institutional contexts.  Asynchronous online activities are extended through in-person and virtual face-to-face learning communities on participating campuses.
