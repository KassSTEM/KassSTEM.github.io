This microcredential offered by the [University of Texas at Austin](https://executive.engr.utexas.edu/prof-dev/courses/inclusive-engineering-fundamentals) follows a standards-aligned, strategy-driven leadership development model for equipping engineers with skills to appreciate differences in the workplace and to collaborate, design, and lead inclusively. In a four-part, iterative, reflective, and reflexive framework, the course will teach inclusive engineering fundamentals that align with standardized ABET engineering outcomes and makes visible a pervasive hidden curriculum that perpetuates disparities within engineering.
