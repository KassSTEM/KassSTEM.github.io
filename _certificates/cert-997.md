This microcredential course was developed to prepare K-12 educators to bring computer science into their instruction, regardless of the subject matter â€” no CS experience necessary. Topics covered include computational thinking, programming, debugging, computer science pedagogy, and computer science integration. This microcredential course is offered by [CSEveryone](https://cseveryone.org/), formally known as the Kenneth C. Griffin CS Education for All Initiative, which is embedded in the School for Teaching and Learning within the College of Education at the University of Florida.
