NASA's Open Science 101 course provides a foundational knowledge of the principles and best practices for conducting open science. It is intended for career researchers, students, and interested members of the general public. Open science is a commitment to the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) as early as possible in the scientific process. Open science practices can result in more collaborations, additional review and validation of results, and increased citations of the work, while increasing public confidence in the results and research process. You can apply to take the course for free through [NASA Open Science's website](https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/s/course-offering/a0BSJ0000029hSn/open-science-101).
