The Universities Research Association (URA) seeks to enhance awareness of the science policy engagement process for early career scientists to help bridge the gap between science and policy through the [Science Policy and Advocacy for Research Competition (SPARC)](https://ura-hq.org/science-policy-2/sparc-science-policy-advocacy-for-research-competition/). This 10-week-long science communication and policy training program is designed to teach STEM PhDs and postdoctoral trainees the essential skills required for a career in science policy. It covers a wide range of topics, including policy development, science communication, and career pathways. Additional topics covered include how to find resources and funding opportunities, and best practices for networking.
